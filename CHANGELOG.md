# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [v0.9.3] – YouTube Cookie Fallback (post-release)

Fixed:
- Added an optional, fallback-only YouTube cookies.txt path that retries only access-gated failures once with cookies before marking video jobs as permanently failed; music mode and existing anonymous behavior continue to run unchanged.

Fixed:
- Restored reliable Direct URL downloads for video and audio (mp3/m4a/etc).
- Corrected yt-dlp invocation for audio formats (uses extract-audio instead of merge-output-format).
- Fixed Direct URL runs appearing permanently queued in the Home UI.
- Prevented empty or zero-byte output files from being recorded as completed.
- Fixed scheduler playlist downloads producing incorrect formats or audio-only output.
- Ensured scheduler and direct downloads can run concurrently without interference.
- Fixed missing database schema initialization for search-related tables.
- Normalized all filesystem paths via paths.py and environment variables (Docker-safe).
- Fixed Advanced Search “Failed to load requests” error caused by search DB store calling service-only logic.
- Fixed Home screen results remaining stuck in “Queued” by restoring reliable search request status hydration.
- Unified search job database usage to a single canonical path to prevent schema and state mismatches.

Changed:
- Direct URL playlist links are now explicitly rejected with a clear user-facing error message.
- Direct URL runs bypass the job queue but still report progress and completion via run status.
- Search-only results can now be downloaded individually via the Home results UI.
- Default video downloads respect configured format preferences (e.g., webm/mp4).
- Metadata enrichment failures no longer block or corrupt completed downloads.

Notes:
- Playlist URLs must be added via Scheduler / Playlist configuration, not Direct URL mode.
- Kill-download button is not guaranteed during active runs and remains experimental.
- Watcher functionality is present but considered beta and may change in later releases.

## [v0.9.2] – Search Engine Dialed In // Home Page UI Update

Highlights

This release hardens the download pipeline (especially audio-only MP3), improves observability, and simplifies the Home UI ahead of broader feature work. Video downloads remain stable and unchanged.

⸻

🚀 Improvements • Reliable MP3 audio-only downloads • Audio mode now uses a robust bestaudio[acodec!=none]/bestaudio/best selector. • Prevents unnecessary video downloads when targeting MP3. • Matches known-working yt-dlp CLI behavior. • Works consistently for direct URLs and queued jobs. • Safer yt-dlp option handling • Avoids forced merge/remux unless explicitly required. • Reduces ffmpeg post-processing failures. • Audio and video paths are now clearly separated and predictable. • yt-dlp CLI observability • Job workers now log the exact yt-dlp CLI command executed (with secrets redacted). • Makes debugging format, cookie, and extractor issues significantly easier.

⸻

🧠 Behavior Fixes • Post-processing failures are now terminal • ffmpeg / post-processing errors correctly mark jobs as FAILED. • Prevents silent re-queue loops and misleading “Queued” states in the UI. • Video pipeline preserved • Default video behavior (bestvideo+bestaudio/best) remains unchanged. • MP4 / MKV / WebM downloads continue to work as before.

⸻

🎧 Music & Metadata • Music metadata enrichment remains optional • Failed or low-confidence enrichment no longer blocks successful downloads. • Clear logging when metadata is skipped due to confidence thresholds.

⸻

🖥 UI / UX • Home page cleanup • Reorganized source filters and advanced options into a single compact row. • Reduced visual noise without removing functionality. • Improved spacing and alignment for music mode, format, and destination controls. • Advanced Search remains available • Advanced functionality is still accessible via the dedicated Advanced Search page.

⸻

🧹 Internal / Maintenance • Improved internal option auditing logs. • Better separation between search, enqueue, and execution logic. • No schema or config migrations required.

⸻

⚠️ Known Notes • Client-side (“download to this device”) delivery is still being refined and may be disabled or hidden in some UI paths.

## [v0.9.1] – Runtime Stability & Direct URL Fixes

Fixed scheduler playlist downloads producing incorrect formats or audio-only output.
Ensured scheduler and direct downloads can run concurrently without interference.
Fixed missing database schema initialization for search-related tables.
Normalized all filesystem paths via paths.py and environment variables (Docker-safe).
Fixed Advanced Search “Failed to load requests” error caused by search DB store calling service-only logic.
Fixed Home screen results remaining stuck in “Queued” by restoring reliable search request status hydration.
Unified search job database usage to a single canonical path to prevent schema and state mismatches.

Direct URL playlist links are now explicitly rejected with a clear user-facing error message.
Direct URL runs bypass the job queue but still report progress and completion via run status.
Search-only results can now be downloaded individually via the Home results UI.
Default video downloads respect configured format preferences (e.g., webm/mp4).

Watcher functionality is present but considered beta and may change in later releases.

## [v0.9.0] – Retreivr Rebrand Release // Music Mode and Metadata
- Project renamed to Retreivr
- Repository migrated to new namespace
- Branding updated across documentation, UI, and Docker artifacts

Added:
- Music mode (opt-in per playlist and per single-URL run) with audio-focused metadata and music-safe naming.
- Smart Search feature - aggregating results from multiple top-tier sources and scoring quality and metadata acquisition, ranking results, and simplifying the entire media-searching process for users.
- yt-dlp cookies support (Netscape cookies.txt) for improved YouTube Music metadata.
- Music filename template support (artist/album/track hierarchy).
- Music metadata enrichment pipeline (MusicBrainz + optional AcoustID + artwork) with background tagging.
- UI controls for music mode, cookies, music template, and metadata enrichment options.
- Config UI controls for watcher enable, backoff timing, and downtime window.
- Per-playlist subscribe mode (only download new videos after first run).
- Single-playlist run controls in the Web UI.
- Single-URL delivery modes (server library or one-time client download via HTTP).
- Button to Kill downloads in progress (cancel active run from Status Section).
- Adaptive watcher with per-playlist state persisted in SQLite.
- Watch policy config with downtime windows and backoff timing.

Changed:
- Metadata flow now prefers yt-dlp music fields when music mode is enabled.
- Music metadata tagging can overwrite existing yt-dlp tags by default (configurable).
- Music URLs (music.youtube.com) auto-enable music mode for single URL runs.
- Music mode download URLs use music.youtube.com when enabled.
- Music mode respects video formats (does not force audio when final_format is a video).
- Download execution uses a native single-call path with explicit JS runtime/solver and a muxed-video requirement, with hardened fallback on failure.
- Watcher uses a single supervisor loop and deterministic scheduling.
- Downloads respect downtime windows and defer until downtime ends.
- Watcher batches detections with a quiet-window strategy and sends one Telegram summary per batch.
- Status now reports current phase and last error for active runs.

### Summary
This v0.9.0 release marks the official rebrand of the project from **YouTube-Archiver** to **Retreivr**.
The version number has been reset to reflect a new product identity and roadmap.

### Important Notes
- v1.2.0 was the **final release** under the YouTube-Archiver name.
- Versioning resumes at v0.9.0 under the Retreivr name.
- Functionality is unchanged in this release.
- Future releases may introduce breaking changes as APIs, environment variables, and UI contracts are stabilized.
